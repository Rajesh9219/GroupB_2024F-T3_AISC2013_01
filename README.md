Project Overview:
This project is part of the Retail Industry Project with the objective of developing an AI-based system to predict product demand and optimize restocking. The goal is to reduce inventory holding costs while ensuring that products are available when needed. The system will use demand forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) and optimization techniques (e.g., linear programming) to suggest optimal restocking quantities.

Phase 1 Objectives:
Define the inventory optimization problem in retail.
Identify necessary data for demand forecasting, such as sales history, product categories, and seasonal trends.
Design a high-level system architecture for the AI-based inventory optimization system.
Create an initial database schema to store sales and inventory data.
Set up the GitHub repository for version control and documentation.


Repository Structure:
/Data/        - Sample datasets and data sources.
/Models/      - Python scripts for demand forecasting and optimization (to be developed).
/Docs/        - Project documentation (problem statement, architecture design, database schema).
README.md     - Project overview and instructions.

Setup Instructions:
Clone the Repository:https://github.com/Rajesh9219/GroupB_2024F-T3_AISC2013_01/tree/main
git clone <[repository-link](https://github.com/Rajesh9219/GroupB_2024F-T3_AISC2013_01/tree/main)>
Create a New Branch: Each team member should work on a separate branch using the following naming convention:
git checkout -b <team-member-name>/<feature-or-task>
Example:git checkout -b dhanush/forecasting-model
Making Changes:
After making necessary changes, stage your files:
git add .
Commit with a descriptive message:
bash
Copy code: git commit -m "Added initial architecture design"
Push Changes:git push origin <branch-name>
Pull Request (PR): Once a task is complete, submit a PR to merge your branch into the main branch. Ensure peer review before merging.

Collaboration Guidelines:
Use GitHub Issues to track and assign tasks.
Regularly update documentation and code.
Make sure all code is well-documented, and include meaningful commit messages.
For further details, check the project documentation in the /Docs/ folder.
